<h1>Using Postgres as a time series database</h1>
<p>Time series databases (TSDBs) are quite popular these days. To name a
few, there are <a href="https://influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/">InfluxDB</a>, <a href="https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Graphite</a>, <a href="http://druid.io/">Druid</a>, <a href="https://kairosdb.github.io/">Kairos</a>, and
<a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a>. All aim to optimize data storage and querying for
time-based data, which is highly relevant in a physics labs where
there are multitude of "metrics" (to borrow a phrase used frequently
in TSDB documentation) that naturally lend themselves to time series
representation: lab (and individual device) temperatures, vacuum
chamber pressures, and laser powers, just to name a few. Ideally, one
could log various data to one of these databases and then use a tool
like <a href="http://grafana.org/">Grafana</a> to visualize it. Sadly, more traditional relational
databases like <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> are not (currently)
supported by Grafana (although this is now being addressed by a
datasource plugin in development).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are quite a few reasons to favor a traditional
RDBMS over a newfangled TSDB. To name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>Longevity: SQL has been around since the 1970s and became
  standardized in the 1980s.</li>
<li>Ubiquity: almost every server (web or otherwise) has an instance of
  SQL installed. If not, SQLite doesn't even require a server!</li>
<li>Community: not to suggest there aren't good communities with TSDBs,
  but the Postgres and SQLite communities in particular are generally
  quite helpful.  Combined with the longevity aspect, any question one
  may have about how to accomplish a particular task with a SQL
  database is likely to be easily answerable with a simple web search.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post, I will outline a few things I have learned in using SQL
for storing time series data. In particular, I will focus on Postgres,
but the same general principles apply to other dialects. Sample code for
some examples can be found on <a href="https://gitlab.com/mivade/postgres-timeseries">GitLab</a>.</p>
<h2>Schema definition</h2>
<p>One "disadvantage" to SQL is it traditionally requires tightly defined
schema.  In practice when logging time series data, this is not
usually a problem since each measurement device can neatly have its
own column. Where this can become somewhat of nuiscance is when adding
new devices. InfluxDB (for example) gets around this with its query
language being quite flexible. In traditional SQL, the approach would
require altering a table to add a new column. This is not too
difficult in principle, but requires a (naive) program for logging
data to frequently make <code>ALTER TABLE</code> calls and check if columns
already exist. (Note that if using Python, this can be easily dealt
with by using the <a href="https://dataset.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">dataset</a> library.).</p>
<p>In real laboratories, though, we tend to know the kinds of things we
are going to measure. So even if we add new devices that we want to
log data from, we can still come up with a reasonable schema
definition that fits well within the SQL paradigm. As an example,
let's consider storing data from thermocouples in a table. We could
get away with as few as three columns to describe the data: a
timestamp (of course), a name or unique ID of the sensor, and a
temperature measurement. For good measure, we should also add a
primary key ID column to make a grand total of four columns. So far,
our table looks like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code> id |           timestamp           |  sensor   | temperature
----+-------------------------------+-----------+-------------
</code></pre></div>

<p>For the <code>timestamp</code> column, I highly recommend using <code>TIMESTAMP WITH
TIME ZONE</code> rather than <code>TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE</code> (more on why
later).</p>
<p>For efficient querying, we'll want to index the <code>timestamp</code> and
<code>sensor</code> columns. Depending on the number of sensors, it may also make
sense to make a combined index on both, but we can defer this decision
to later if it becomes necessary. Using <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>, we define our
table like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">metadata</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sa</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">MetaData</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="n">metadata</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create_all</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bind</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">engine</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>which results in the following SQL:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>CREATE TABLE timeseries (
    id SERIAL NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    sensor VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
    temperature FLOAT(4) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
CREATE INDEX ix_timeseries_sensor ON timeseries (sensor);
CREATE INDEX ix_timeseries_timestamp ON timeseries (timestamp);
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Basic querying</h2>
<p>Simple queries are performed as normal:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>SELECT * FROM timeseries WHERE sensor = &#39;sensor_01&#39;;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Postgres has quite a few
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/functions-datetime.html">date and time functions</a>
for building more complicated queries. It understands <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> out
of the box:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">test</span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">timeseries</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="o">(</span><span class="nt">2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">rows</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="w"></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here we are explicit with the UTC offset of +2 hours (CEST). If
omitted, the server locale is assumed. This brings us to why we should
bother with time zones in the first place: internally, we want all
timestamps stored in UTC to avoid ambiguity (Postgres already does
this internally). Externally, (e.g., from Python scripts), we want to
be able to use whatever time zone we're in to not have to think too
hard.</p>
<p>SQLAlchemy treats naive <code>datetime</code> objects, uh, naively. This means
that if a new <code>datetime</code> is created without explicitly specifying a
time zone, that +2 hours above is lost and our time quries will start
to get confusing. To avoid this problem, the best solution I have
found is to <strong>always</strong> declare columns as <code>TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE</code>
(<code>DateTime(timezone=True)</code> in SQLAlchemy terms) and explicitly. So
rather than inserting new timestamps with</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">datetime</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">datetime</span>
<span class="c1"># ...</span>
<span class="n">timestamp</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">datetime</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">now</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>instead prefer</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">datetime</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">datetime</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">timezone</span>
<span class="c1"># ...</span>
<span class="n">timestamp</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">datetime</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">now</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">timezone</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">utc</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><em>Aside: why oh why doesn't <code>datetime.utcnow</code> just do this?</em></p>
<p>Now we can build queries in Python like this using pandas and raw SQL
queries:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">today</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">datetime</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">now</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">timezone</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">utc</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">today</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">today</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">replace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">hour</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">minute</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">second</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">microsecond</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;SELECT * FROM timeseries &quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;WHERE timestamp &gt;= &#39;</span><span class="si">{}</span><span class="s2">&#39; &quot;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">today</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">isoformat</span><span class="p">())</span> <span class="o">+</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;AND sensor = &#39;sensor_01&#39;&quot;</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">df</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pd</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">read_sql_query</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">query</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">engine</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">index_col</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;timestamp&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Data aggregation</h2>
<p>Depending on data density, it may be useful to downsample data and look
at aggregates such as the mean temperature in half-hour windows over the
course of a day. We can easily accomplish this after the fact with
pandas, but we can just as easily use Postgres <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/functions-aggregate.html">aggregate functions</a>
to do this for us on the server. One advantage to this approach is a
reduction in network overhead, which is especially relevant for very
large datasets. Another is that these queries can be cached using
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/rules-materializedviews.html">materialized views</a>. (This is a more advanced topic that I will not
cover here. Instead, see the link in the references section below for a
good treatment).</p>
<p>The key here is to use the <code>date_trunc</code> aggregate function and
<code>GROUP BY</code> to only look at (for example) one hour at a time. An example
of an aggregate query:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>SELECT
  date_trunc(&#39;hour&#39;, timestamp) AS timestamp,
  avg(temperature) AS temperature
FROM timeseries
WHERE timestamp &gt;= &#39;2016-06-25&#39;
AND sensor = &#39;sensor_01&#39;
GROUP BY date_trunc(&#39;hour&#39;, timestamp)
ORDER BY timestamp;
</code></pre></div>

<p>which results in something like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>timestamp        |   temperature

<h2>Other strategies</h2>
<p>Another approach to avoid the time zone issue entirely is to simply
store timestamps using something like UNIX time. Since pretty much every
programming language imaginable has a built-in function to return time
in seconds since the epoch, this is a reasonable approach (and is a bit
more portable to other SQL dialects). The major downside to this is that
compared to ISO 8601, UNIX time is not as readable by humans and
therefore may require extra steps to convert to and from a human-readable
format.</p>
<p>Depending on what you are doing with your data, it could also make sense
to store, say, an hour's worth of data in a single row using the <code>ARRAY</code>
data type. Combining arrays with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/functions-array.html">array functions</a> could then
effectively do aggregation (somewhat) automatically rather than by
query. This could also mean a bit of extra work when inserting new data
or getting data stored in the database into a form friendly to your data
analysis tools of choice.</p>
